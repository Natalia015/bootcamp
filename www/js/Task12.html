        Activity 12

        Write a JavaScript function that takes a number as a parameter and check the number is prime or not. 

        Note: 

        Prime numbers are the numbers that are only divisible by themselves and 1, in other words, 
        if we try to divide them by another number, the result is not a whole number. 

        So, if we divide the number by anything other than 1 or itself, we will get a remainder that is not zero. 

        Negative numbers can not be prime.

        function isNumberPrime(number) {
            // check if number is smaller than 2
            if (number <= 1) {
                return console.log("Number is not prime");
            }

            // Check if number can be divided by numbers from 2 to the square root of the number
            for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(number); i++) {
                if (number % i == 0) {
                    // it's not prime
                    console.log(number + " is not a prime number");
                    return false;
                }
            }
            // it's prime
            console.log(number + " is a prime number");
            return true;
        }

        let number = parseInt(prompt('Enter a number: '));

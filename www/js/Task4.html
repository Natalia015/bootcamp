        Activity 4
        Write a JavaScript program that accepts three numbers from the user and prints "Increasing order"
        if the numbers are in the increasing order, "Decreasing order" if the numbers are in the decreasing order, 
        and "Neither increasing or decreasing order" otherwise.

        Test Data:

        Input first number: 1524
        Input second number: 2345
        Input third number: 3321

        Expected Output :

        Increasing order.

        const a = 1524;
        const b = 2345;
        const c = 3321;

        // check if the first number is smaller than the second, and if the second is smaller than the third
        if (a < b && b < c) {
            //if true:
            console.log("Increasing order");
            //check if the first number is bigger than the second, and if the second is bigger than the third
        } else if (a > b && b > c) {

            console.log("Decreasing order");

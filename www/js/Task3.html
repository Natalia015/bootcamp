        Activity 3
        Write a JavaScript program that accepts three numbers and prints "All numbers are equal" 
        if all three numbers are equal, "All numbers are different" if all three numbers are different 
        and "Neither all are equal or different" otherwise.

    Test Data:

    Input first number: 2
    Input second number: 3
    Input third number: 4

    Expected Output :

    All numbers are different.

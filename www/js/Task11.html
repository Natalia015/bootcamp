        Activity 11

        Write a JavaScript function to calculate the factorial of a number (a non-negative integer n ). 
        The function accepts the number as an argument.

        Note:
        The factorial of a number is the product of all the integers from 1 to that number and it is represented by n!

        For example, the factorial of 6! is 1*2*3*4*5*6 = 720. 

        The factorial is not defined for negative numbers, and the factorial of zero is one, 0! = 1.

         factorial = (number) => {
            let result = 1;
            let i = 0;
            if (number == 0 || number == 1) {
                return result;
            }
            else if (number > 1) {
                for ( i = number; i >= 1; i--) {
                    result = result * i;
                }
                return result;
            }
            else {
                return "Number can't be negative"
            }
        }

        let number = parseInt(prompt('Enter a number: '));
        let result = factorial(number)
        console.log("Factorial of " + number + " : " + result);
